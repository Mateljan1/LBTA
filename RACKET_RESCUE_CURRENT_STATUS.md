# 🎾 RACKET RESCUE - CURRENT STATUS

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING ON YOUR DOMAIN

**URL:** https://www.racketrescue.com/schedule

**Working Features:**
- ✅ Match-Ready ($35) & Pro-Performance ($50) selection
- ✅ Express service add-on
- ✅ "I'll provide my own string" option  
- ✅ String Wizard button (red now!)
- ✅ 5 Tennis Warehouse strings showing:
  - Wilson Velocity MLT - $18
  - Babolat RPM Blast - $22
  - Luxilon ALU Power - $25
  - Wilson NXT - $20

**Deployment:** Last successful build (ID: dpl_7H2HCHDiKu1b4Rch7UrrK6mRxvsR)

## ⚠️ WHAT'S NOT WORKING YET

**Build Errors:** Recent deploys failing due to:
- ESLint errors (apostrophes, quotes)
- Missing imports
- TypeScript issues

**Missing Features (in code but not deployed):**
- 12-string expanded catalog
- Auto-population of racket models
- Grip selection
- Service add-ons
- Working string wizard recommendations

---

## 🎯 WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN

**Option 1:** I fix ALL remaining errors and deploy clean ✅
**Option 2:** You use what's live now (works but limited features)

**Current site is FUNCTIONAL** - customers can:
- Select service
- Choose from 5 popular strings
- Add express service
- Provide own string
- Continue through flow

**It's not perfect but it WORKS!**

---

**Your call:** Should I spend time fixing all build errors to deploy the enhanced version, or is the current working version good enough for now?

The current version has the core functionality - just not all the bells and whistles I added! 🎾
