2. Check mobile responsiveness (especially video)
3. Verify all images load correctly
4. Test form submission

### Week 1:
1. A/B test headline variants
2. Monitor form completion rate (should increase with 3 fields)
3. Check PageSpeed score improvement
4. Gather user feedback

### Week 2+:
1. Add video testimonials to Community scene
2. Implement actual parallax (currently standard scroll)
3. Add blur placeholders to images
