## Latest Deployment

**Commit:** 862b8f7  
**Message:** "Trigger fresh deployment with environment variables configured"  
**Status:** Building → Will be Ready in ~4 minutes  
**Includes:** All environment variables

---

## Why Previous Tests Failed

**Issue:** Deployment timing mismatch
- Previous deployment built BEFORE environment variables were added
- So it had the code but not the credentials

**Solution:** Fresh deployment (862b8f7) building now WITH credentials

---

## Test Instructions

**After 4 minutes from now:**

1. Visit: https://lagunabeachtennisacademy.com/schedules
2. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Click Junior Programs → Little Tennis Stars
4. Click "Register for Little Tennis Stars"
5. Fill modal:
   - Select days (Monday, Wednesday)
   - Select frequency (1x or 2x per week)
   - Enter your email
   - Fill contact info
6. Submit
7. **Check email within 2 minutes**

---

## Verification Points

**Success will look like:**
- ✅ Success message on website
- ✅ New row in Notion database
- ✅ New contact in ActiveCampaign with Tag 33
- ✅ Email in your inbox
- ✅ Automation shows "Entered: 2"

---

## If Still Not Working

**Check:**
1. Vercel deployment status (should be READY)
2. Browser console for errors (F12)
3. Notion database (new entry?)
4. ActiveCampaign (new contact?)

**Most likely:** Just need to wait for deployment to complete.
