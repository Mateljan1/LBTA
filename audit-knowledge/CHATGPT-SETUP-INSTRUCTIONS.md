## TROUBLESHOOTING

### "GPT is missing some context"
- Verify all 12 .md files uploaded (not just some)
- Check that system instructions fully pasted
- Wait 5-10 minutes for ChatGPT to index knowledge

### "Knowledge files not being referenced"
- Check file names (should be .md not .pdf)
- Verify file size (each should be 10-30KB)
- Try asking question that directly references a file content

### "Responses feel generic"
- Remind GPT of framework: "Use the 12-dimension audit framework from File 09"
- Explicitly ask for revenue impact calculations
- Request competitive benchmarking by name

### "Can't find a specific recommendation"
- Check which file it's in (see summary table above)
- Ask GPT specifically: "Based on [File X], what should we do about [topic]?"
