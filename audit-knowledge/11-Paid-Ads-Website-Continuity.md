## REVENUE IMPACT CALCULATION

### Formula
```
Ad Spend × CTR × Landing Page Conversion × ACV = Revenue

Example:
$10,000 spend × 1.5% CTR = 150 clicks
150 clicks × 10% conversion = 15 leads
15 leads × 20% sales = 3 customers
3 customers × $2,000 ACV = $6,000 revenue
Profit: $6,000 - $10,000 = -$4,000

BUT: Improve CTR to 1.8% (wrong angle)
180 clicks × 10% conversion = 18 leads
18 × 20% = 3.6 customers = $7,200 revenue
Profit: $7,200 - $10,000 = -$2,800 (better)

AND: Improve landing page conversion to 15% (copy alignment)
180 clicks × 15% conversion = 27 leads
27 × 20% = 5.4 customers = $10,800 revenue
Profit: $10,800 - $10,000 = +$800 (profitable!)
```
