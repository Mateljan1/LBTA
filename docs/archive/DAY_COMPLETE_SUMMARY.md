## REMAINING CRITICAL ISSUE

### Font Accessibility STILL BROKEN

**All attempts failed:**
1. ✗ Space Grotesk via Next.js + latin-ext
2. ✗ DM Sans replacement
3. ✗ Space Grotesk via CSS @import
4. ✗ Work Sans via CSS @import

**Problem persists:**
- "Tennis" → "Tenni"
- "Coaches" → "Coache"
- "Discipline" → "Di cipline"

**Root cause unknown** - Not the font itself, something deeper

**Options:**
1. Accept it (visually works, screen readers broken)
2. Investigate further (CSS rendering issue?)
3. Try local font files (self-host)
