## ✅ NEW LANGUAGE (Aman Standard)

### **Principles:**
1. **Short sentences.** No fluff.
2. **Active voice.** Direct.
3. **Real words.** No corporate speak.
4. **Human tone.** Conversational but refined.

### **Before vs. After Examples:**

#### **Hero Section**
**Before:** "Excellence Built Here"  
**After:** "Your Championship Journey Starts in Laguna Beach."  
**Why:** Customer-centric, direct, human

#### **Programs Page**
**Before:** "Structured development for every age and skill level. From first lesson to professional tour."  
**After:** "Ages 3 to professional. Beginners to tour players. Find what fits."  
**Why:** Shorter. Clearer. No jargon.

#### **About Page - Values**
**Before:** "Transformational Excellence - We don't just pursue perfect technique—we cultivate the clarity, persistence, and mental strength that elevates every aspect of life."  
**After:** "The Work - Perfect technique takes time. What happens faster: mental clarity, physical discipline, the confidence that comes from doing hard things well."  
**Why:** Real talk. No corporate nonsense.

#### **ATP Story**
**Before:** "Through systematic movement refinement and mental conditioning, he climbed 600 ATP ranking positions."  
**After:** "We worked on movement efficiency and match mindset. Twelve months later, he'd climbed 600 ATP ranking spots."  
**Why:** Simpler verbs. Human narrative.

#### **Pricing Page**
**Before:** "Investment in Excellence - The value of tennis extends beyond the court. Your investment develops character, discipline, and championship mindset alongside technical mastery."  
**After:** "What It Costs - Tennis teaches more than technique. It builds character, discipline, and confidence that last a lifetime."  
**Why:** Direct. No pretense. Real benefits.

#### **Coaches Page**
**Before:** "You'll train with coaches who bring ATP/WTA tour experience, NCAA recruitment expertise, and unwavering commitment to your individual development."  
**After:** "ATP/WTA tour experience. NCAA recruitment expertise. Coaches who've trained at the highest levels and know how to teach beginners."  
**Why:** Facts. No adjectives. Straight talk.
