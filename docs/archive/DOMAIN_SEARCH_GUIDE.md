## ✅ VERIFIED VIA MCP (Definitely NOT Here)

**Checked via MCP integrations:**

❌ **WordPress.com** - NOT your registrar (verified)  
❌ **GoDaddy** - NOT in your account (checked 40+ domains, LBTA not there)  
❌ **cPanel** - Connection timeout (likely no cPanel hosting)  

**Conclusion:** Domain is registered elsewhere.

## ⚠️ WHY THIS IS CRITICAL

**Can't proceed with deployment until you find registrar because:**

1. **Need DNS access** - Must update A record + CNAME
2. **Need to verify expiration** - Don't want domain expiring during migration
3. **Need nameserver info** - To plan migration strategy
4. **Need to preserve MX records** - Email must keep working
5. **Need rollback ability** - If something goes wrong

**Without registrar access = Can't migrate safely**

---

## 🎯 ONCE YOU FIND IT

**Tell new agent:**

*"Found domain registrar: [NAME]. Current nameservers are [NS1, NS2]. Ready to deploy to Vercel."*

**Then we can:**
1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Set up redirects
3. Update DNS safely
4. Migrate with zero downtime
5. Preserve #1 SEO ranking

## 📞 ALTERNATIVE: Call Your Domain Contact

**If you can't find it:**

**Option 1:** Check who set up the domain originally
- Did Andrew Mateljan register it?
- Did a web developer set it up?
- Was it included with Unbounce?

**Option 2:** Contact Unbounce support
- Ask where domain is registered
