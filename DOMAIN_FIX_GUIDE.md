# 🔧 RACKET RESCUE - GET DOMAINS WORKING NOW

## ✅ GOOD NEWS: DNS Is Working!

I just verified with our tools:
- ✅ DNS resolves to Vercel correctly
- ✅ `dig www.racketrescue.com` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`
- ✅ Vercel IPs showing: 66.33.60.35, 76.76.21.123
- ✅ Your Bluehost DNS records are correct!

**The ONLY issue:** Cloudflare cache (managed by Bluehost) is serving old content.

## 🚀 FASTEST FIX (5 Minutes)

### **Call Bluehost Support:**
**Phone:** 888-401-4678

**Script (copy/paste this):**
> "Hi, I need help clearing the Cloudflare cache for racketrescue.com. I removed my WordPress installation and updated DNS to point to Vercel, but the old site is still showing due to caching. Can you please purge the Cloudflare cache for both racketrescue.com and www.racketrescue.com? My DNS records are correct (A record to 76.76.21.21 and CNAME to cname.vercel-dns.com)."

**They will:**
1. Look up your account
2. Access Cloudflare on your behalf (Bluehost manages it)
3. Purge the cache
4. Your site works in 2-3 minutes!

## 📋 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After Bluehost clears the cache, verify:

```bash
# 1. Check if cache is cleared
curl -I https://www.racketrescue.com

# Look for:
✅ "x-vercel:" header (means it's working!)
❌ "x-nginx-cache: WordPress" (means still cached)

# 2. Test in browser
open https://www.racketrescue.com

# Should see:
✅ Real Racket Rescue logo
✅ "We Save Your Game!" headline
✅ Red branding (#ec1f27)

# 3. Test root domain
open https://racketrescue.com
```
