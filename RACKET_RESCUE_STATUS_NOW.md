## ⏳ CUSTOM DOMAINS (Waiting for Cache)

### **Why www.racketrescue.com isn't working yet:**

1. ✅ DNS is configured correctly in Bluehost
2. ✅ WordPress is removed
3. ✅ Domains are connected to Vercel
4. ❌ **Bluehost is using Cloudflare CDN** (automatic - you don't need an account)
5. ❌ Cloudflare cache still has old WordPress pages

### **What's Happening:**
- Bluehost automatically uses Cloudflare for caching
- The cache has old WordPress pages stored
- Cache expires automatically (usually 1-4 hours)
- Sometimes takes up to 24 hours for full propagation

---

## 🔧 SOLUTION: WAIT OR USE WORKAROUND

### **Option 1: Just Wait** (1-4 hours)
- Bluehost/Cloudflare cache will expire automatically
- DNS will fully propagate
- Custom domains will start working
- No action needed from you

### **Option 2: Use Vercel URL Now** (WORKS IMMEDIATELY!)
**https://racket-rescue-site.vercel.app**

- Works perfectly right now!
- All features functional
- Correct branding
- Elite design
- Can use this until custom domains work

### **Option 3: Contact Bluehost Support** (10 min)
Call Bluehost: **888-401-4678**

Say: *"I removed my WordPress installation and need to clear the Cloudflare cache for racketrescue.com. Can you purge the cache or help the DNS propagate to my new host?"*

They can manually clear the cache immediately.
